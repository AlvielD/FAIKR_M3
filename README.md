### Authors

### Usage

The project can be tryed out by simply executing the [notebook](https://github.com/AlvielD/FAIKR_M3/blob/main/src/Transport_network.ipynb) on it.

### Description of the project

To build the model we were inspired by the structure presented in the textbook ["Bayesian Networks: With Examples in R"](https://g.co/kgs/H4rYJ3) by Marco Scutari 2015. We decide to add some new variables in order to perform some interesting queries and to test the performance when subjected to different amounts of data.

### Some remarks

It is highly suggested to read the [report](https://github.com/AlvielD/FAIKR_M3/blob/main/docs/FAIKR_M3_report.pdf) in order to understand the purposes of the project and the experiments performed on it.

The project was developed using the [pgmpy](https://pgmpy.org/) library for python.
