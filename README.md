# FAIKR_M3
Repository for the miniproject of FAIKR Modulo 3

## Possible Experiments to be done:
    - Add another varible to the net
    - Add another values to some variables of the net
    - Performing of some queries (at least one of each type: Causal, Evidential and Intercausal)
    - Do something related to the Markov Blanket (There is already a function(?))
    - Implementation of the inference by enumeration method and compare it with the variable elimination method already implemented in pgmpy (Print also the tree?)
